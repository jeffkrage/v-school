    <h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1>
<h2>Director Demands Investigation</h2>

<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured  
    hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p> 
<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
</p>
<p>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>* the Cold War</li>
    <li>* the civil-rights movement</li>
    <li>* the growth of the international drug trade</li>
</ul>
